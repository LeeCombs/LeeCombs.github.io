This site is live, and quite volatile at the moment. The will change quite a bit until I determine the overall style for it.

As for substance, it will be a blog that covers my attempts at learning to create a game, the development of that game, and things I learn along the way.
Initially it will have me learning and attempting to explain Entity Component Systems and how it works with the Nez framework and C#.
It may also house my portfolio and past projects, but that may just be reserved as a personal site instead.

From there I hope to start an indie game development studio/site/company/whatever, and transition into that. Time will tell.

Thanks for checking me out!
